    "content":"It actually depends. Please read until the end because this is a big one. I am typing this answer on 13th October 2020. I don’t know when this question was asked. Now I bought a Dell laptop for the 2nd time. First, when I was a baby and my dad bought one. It was a Dell Inspiron, not sure which model it was. That laptop was superb. It was so good. it was fast, it could run GTA Vice City smoothly(At that time, GTA Vice City was a popular game), and much more cool stuff. My dad bought that laptop in 2007. It became slow in 2012, so we bought an HP ProBook. That laptop was thicker than the old Dell Laptop, but it was fast. It didn’t heat up. It was almost perfect. It was really a nice laptop. I used that Laptop till august 30th. After that, the laptop became slow, we bought a new Dell Laptop. Now, this new Dell Laptop is for me, for my online classes. Now I am 13 years old. The laptop's name was Dell Inspiron 5400 14 inches. When I opened the box, the laptop looked so good. It was shining, a nice color, a stylus pen, it was a convertible laptop(x360). I did feel a bit sad as I wanted a Gaming Laptop, but my dad refused. I was fine with it. Before ordering this laptop, we had 2 choices, whether to buy the HP Pavilion x360 or buy Dell Inspiron. We first thought of buying it in Amazon, but then it was better to buy it from a store directly. So we went to the store. We first saw the HP Pavilion x360, but I didn’t like the keyboard of it. So we went to see Dell Inspiron. It was really amazing. The screen is full HD, it was light, it has fast charging and many more."
